# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
I really like planning building and testing vs trying to see if everything will work at the end. It builds cleaner code and the team memebers are up to speed on how the files are structured and what the purpose of it all is. 

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)? we used github projects and would break apart different responsibilities for the team and deadlines for them to get done. 

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
Honestly i'm not sure. At first I was the team lead but then we kind of all were.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
I have no idea. 

5. How does retro function in a team project?
We all communicated a lot during the whole project so retros were for setting new goals. 

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations? We all had dissagreements and would kind of let each other work they way they needed to work. 

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
I'm very open about what i'm thinking. I tend to say what I want to happen and what could improve. I also love to get feedback from people so I take the direct approach and encourage my team memebers to say what they are thinking.
